## *Description:*   
#### *Want to play some number game? With a click of a button some of your numbers will be replaced with phrases. It's up to you how far you want to go!*   
This project conclude my third week at Epicodus as a full-time student. **The goal** of the project is to build an application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number (or from the input down to 0 for reverse method) with the following exceptions:
* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* Exceptions for 3 have the highest priority, for 2 - second priority, and for 1 - last priority.
